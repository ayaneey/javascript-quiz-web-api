# Javascript-Quiz-Web-Api
In this project, I created a quiz containing a series of questions where the user will have a total of 60 seconds to complete all 5 questions. I have desgined the quiz so that the user will gain points for every correct response and lose points irrespectively, for every incorrect question as well as having seconds deducted from the timer. See below for snapshots of the projects:
